## PREAMBLE

The Attribution and Source Continuity License (ASCL) is a strong copyleft license designed for software and other technical works, ensuring perpetual freedom, transparency, and proper attribution.

### Purpose and Philosophy

Many software licenses permit the creation of proprietary derivatives or allow original authors to be obscured or forgotten. In contrast, this License ensures that:

1. **Freedom is preserved**: Software remains publicly available and freely modifiable
2. **Source code remains accessible**: Complete source code must accompany all distributions
3. **Attribution is maintained**: Original authors receive clear, visible, and permanent credit
4. **Derivatives remain free**: All modifications and adaptations remain under the same terms

### Modern Development Practices

This License explicitly addresses contemporary software development methods, including:

- Code refactoring and restructuring
- Reimplementation in different programming languages
- Translation between technology stacks
- Use of artificial intelligence and automated code generation tools
- Machine learning-assisted development

The License treats works created through these methods as derivative works when substantial similarity to the original exists, regardless of the method used to create them.

### Governing Principles

This License protects both:
- The **freedom of downstream users** to use, study, modify, and redistribute the work
- The **integrity and reputation** of original authors through mandatory attribution

All interpretations of this License shall favor these core principles.

   - (a) The Software was included in the training data used to create the AI system; or
   - (b) The Software was provided as input, context, or reference material to the AI system; or
   - (c) The resulting work exhibits substantial similarity to the Software as defined in Section 1.8

**10.2 Burden of Proof**  
Where an AI-generated work exhibits substantial similarity to the Software, the burden of proving independent creation rests with the party claiming the work is not derivative.

**10.3 No Exemption for Automated Creation**  
The method of creation does not exempt a work from this License. Specifically:
   - (a) Use of AI or automated tools does not constitute independent creation
   - (b) Claims of "emergent" generation do not exempt substantially similar works
   - (c) Clean-room development claims require clear evidence of process isolation

**10.4 Training Data Considerations**  
If You train an AI system using the Software as training data, any output from that system that embodies or reproduces the Software's logic, structure, or behavior is a Derivative Work subject to this License.

### SECTION 11: AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

**11.1 Permitted Aggregation**  
Inclusion of the Covered Work in an aggregate compilation with other separate and independent works does not cause this License to apply to those other works, provided that:
   - (a) The other works are genuinely independent and not extensions of the Covered Work
   - (b) The works are not combined to form a single larger program
   - (c) The aggregate is not used to circumvent any requirement of this License

**11.2 Definition of Aggregate**  
An "aggregate" means a collection of works in or on a volume of storage or distribution medium where the individual works remain separate and independent.

**11.3 Examples of Aggregation**  
Permissible aggregation includes:
   - (a) Including the Software on a compilation DVD with other software
   - (b) Distributing the Software alongside other tools in a software collection
   - (c) Packaging the Software with documentation or tutorials

**11.4 Examples of Non-Aggregation**  
The following are NOT mere aggregation and require the combined work to be licensed under this License:
   - (a) Linking the Software with other code to form a single executable
   - (b) Creating plugins or extensions that depend on the Software's internal structures
   - (c) Embedding the Software within a larger application

**13.5 No Reinstatement**  
Once terminated, Your rights under this License cannot be reinstated except by express written permission from the Copyright Holder.

### SECTION 14: CONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL OF PERMISSION

**14.1 Right of Withdrawal**  
In addition to the termination rights in Section 13, the Copyright Holder reserves the right, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to withdraw permission for continued use of the Software within a specific Derivative Work where:
   - (a) Continued use causes demonstrable reputational harm to the Copyright Holder; or
   - (b) Persistent and material misrepresentation has occurred despite notice; or

   - (b) Copies lawfully obtained by third parties prior to withdrawal remain valid
   - (c) The affected party may create new Derivative Works if they cure the violation
   - (d) Withdrawal applies prospectively, not retroactively

**14.4 Limitation on Withdrawal**  
This Section shall not be construed to allow arbitrary or discriminatory withdrawal, but only to prevent material harm or persistent bad faith violations.

### SECTION 15: INTERPRETATION OF DERIVATIVE WORKS

**15.1 Presumption of Derivation**  
Where ambiguity exists as to whether a work constitutes a Derivative Work, such ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of finding derivation where substantial similarity exists in:
   - (a) Overall program structure, sequence, and organization
   - (b) Algorithms, logic, or computational methods
   - (c) Data structures and their relationships
   - (d) Interface design and user interaction patterns
   - (e) Output behavior and functionality

**15.2 Insufficient to Avoid Derivative Status**  
The following actions, alone or in combination, are insufficient to avoid classification as a Derivative Work where substantial similarity exists:
   - (a) Renaming variables, functions, classes, or modules
   - (b) Changing code formatting, indentation, or comment style
   - (c) Reordering code sections or refactoring internal structure
   - (d) Translating to a different programming language
   - (e) Converting between programming paradigms (e.g., procedural to object-oriented)
   - (f) Reimplementing using different libraries or frameworks
   - (g) Adding new features or functionality alongside similar existing functionality

**15.3 Expert Analysis**  
Substantial similarity may be established through expert analysis using recognized methods of software comparison, including but not limited to:
   - (a) Static analysis of source code
   - (b) Dynamic analysis of runtime behavior
   - (c) Comparison of algorithms and data flows
   - (d) Examination of architectural patterns

**15.4 Independent Creation Defense**  
To successfully claim independent creation, one must demonstrate:
   - (a) No access to the Software or its Source Code during development
   - (b) Documentation of the independent development process
   - (c) Significant differences in implementation approach and structure
   - (d) An alternative explanation for any similarities

### SECTION 16: INTERPRETATION OF ATTRIBUTION AND SOURCE AVAILABILITY

**16.1 Effective Attribution**  
This License shall be interpreted to require attribution that is:
   - (a) Actually visible and accessible to users under normal circumstances
   - (b) Reasonably prominent relative to the size and nature of the work
   - (c) Not hidden behind technical barriers, optional settings, or obscure navigation
   - (d) Presented in a manner that clearly identifies the original Copyright Holder

**16.2 Effective Source Availability**  
This License shall be interpreted to require Source Code availability that is:
   - (a) Genuinely accessible to the general public without barriers
   - (b) In a complete and buildable form
   - (c) Without restrictions that effectively prevent modification
   - (d) Maintained with reasonable availability and reliability

**16.3 Anti-Circumvention Principle**  
Interpretations that permit formal compliance while undermining the substantive purpose of attribution or source availability requirements shall be disfavored and are contrary to the intent of this License.

**16.4 Good Faith Compliance**  
All obligations under this License require good faith compliance in both letter and spirit. Technical compliance that defeats the purpose of a requirement is not sufficient.

### SECTION 17: INTERPRETATION OF TERMINATION AND WITHDRAWAL

**17.1 Immediate Effect**  
Termination under Section 13 occurs automatically upon violation without requirement of notice, declaration, or legal proceeding.

**17.2 Retroactive Effect**  
Termination has immediate retroactive effect:
   - (a) Any distributions made after the violation occurred are unauthorized
   - (b) The violator may be liable for copyright infringement for post-violation activities
   - (c) Prior lawful distributions remain lawful

**17.3 Prospective Withdrawal**  
Withdrawal under Section 14 operates prospectively from the date of notice:
   - (a) It does not create retroactive liability for past distributions
   - (b) It may require cessation of ongoing distribution where legally possible
   - (c) It does not affect the validity of copies already in circulation

**17.4 Evidence of Violation**  
A Copyright Holder seeking to enforce termination or withdrawal bears the burden of proving violation by a preponderance of the evidence.
